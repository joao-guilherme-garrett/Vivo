In this repository there are two projects I made for myself, to learn JAVA and Vue.js. I have many others in C# or React, for example, but I don't want to put a lot of stuff just to make it 'feel bigger'.
There are other projects that I unfortunatelly deleted after delivery, and some that I have done inside my client's hardware, and lost access then.
There are also some projects I cannot put here for the confidentiallity of the business logic.
But here are some worth mentioning:

>>> I automated the process for an English Course (as for the class creation). The project was simple and my first full-stack one. I used ChatGPT as the resource for the automation, and it consisted in this:
    the person would type a subject and the program would then create a class with 36 words or phrases regarding that subject, 12 common phrases, and 5 verbs.
    Then, it would translate each item and create an exercise for each of these.
    I left the project with only one adjustment missing, that was planned, that was the automatic creation of the PDF with the content.

>>> I created an app for evaluating bets and showing sports info, by constructing a web scrapper that retrieves information from Google.

>>> I am currently finishing the redesign of Sales CRM, the company ERP, and the Logistics WMS system of my current job, building the softwares from scratch and integrating all the business logic.
    It's a company that sells over 20 million reais per month and all the processes will be integrated into a system of a Market Place, that will be launched next year.
    I'm just finishing the projects and it will be presented this week to the owner so after he aproves a software house will build the softwares.
    To be honest, in this project, the crucial part was not the code as it was not that hard to figure it out, but specially to understand the needs of the business and every process,
    talk to the employees and realize what works and what should be improved, and how to do that. It was a challenge but totally worth it for the knowledge and professional growth.

It's also profitable to mention my test for the German company, which I unfortunatelly deleted, but consisted creating a Helm Chart for a Nginx Ingress Controller Docker file.

With this you can see some about who I am. If you're looking for a super expert that knows it all, I am not that person. I have experience, yes, but there are many out there who know more than I do.
But if you are looking for a results-driven individual who will deliver to you whatever you require, independently of being something I know previously or not,
trying to think the process through and see the big picture of it all before everything, and that is always eager to learn and evolve,
then you may have found your guy.

Please feel free to get in touch for anything else you need. Have a great day! God bless.
